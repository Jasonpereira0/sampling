# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation - Jason Pereira

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `3`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey is to explore the relationship between music taste and age and undeestand how perceptions of popular music spread across various age groups and how preferences in choice of music change over their lifetime.

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
The Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (GVP), 2018 (Cycle 33) conducted by Statistics Canada is a comprehensive survey aimed at understanding charitable giving, volunteering, and participation in Canada.

1. Sample type - Stratified probability sampling was implemented for the survey. Stratification was done at the provincial and census metropolitian area and used a two-stage sampling approach where the primary sampling units were groups of telephone numbers and the secondary sampling units were individuals within households. Only one individual over the age of 15 per household was selected to participate.

2. Sample size - The survey had a target of 50,000 units out of which 40,000 invitation letters for the electronic questionnaire were dispatched to the selected households.

3. Target population - The target population was individuals aged 15 and above residing in private households across Canada's 10 provinces. However, it excluded Canada's 3 territories.

4. Sampling frame - The sampling frame consisted of landline and mobile phone numbers obtained through Statistics Canada's internal databases.

5. Survey mode(s) - The surveys were conducted via telephone interviews and online questionnaires.

6. Timeline - Survey data period was between September 4 and December 28, 2018.

7. Response rate - Out of the 50,000 target sample size, the expected numebr of compeleted questionnaires was 24,000 which is about 48% response rate.

8. Weights - Weights were used to correct for unequal selection chances and non-responses, ensuring the results represent Canadians aged 15 and older. Adjustments were also made based on Census demographic data.

9. Data processing - Statistics Canada ensured data quality by applying control measures, standardizing responses, and verifying consistency and accuracy.

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc - Data cleaning involved fixing inconsistencies and filling in missing values, likely using methods such as deterministic or probabilistic techniques to address gaps in demographic or response data.

11. Sources of error - Sampling error caused due to variability. Non-response bias caused due to differences between respondents and non-respondents. Coverage error due to population exclusions in the 3 territories. Measurement errors due to survey participants misinterpreting question and responding incorrectly.

12. Limitations, known biases, etc - Exclusion of the three Canadian territories, the new introduction of electronic delivery of the questionaires make it difficult to compare it to previous survey cycles. 

13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used - https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&Id=796234
